# php-string-converter
Simple UI for converting strings.

Years ago, a Firefox update broke my beloved HackBar plugin, so I wrote this little utility to give me back most of the Hackbar features. I still use this utility every day.

### Some of the features...

- url encode / decode
- base 64 encode / decode
- guid
- md5
- sha1
- uniqid
- htmlentities encode/decode
- preg_quote
- json_decode

Plus a few things probably only I would ever use.
